I turn ideas into clean, scalable, and user-friendly web applications that people love to use. With 3+ years of professional experience as a Frontend Developer, I specialize in building responsive and accessible applications using React, JavaScript (ES6+), Next.js, and modern CSS frameworks.

My expertise spans across developing scalable frontend components, implementing state management (Redux, Zustand), integrating RESTful APIs, and optimizing applications for performance and accessibility. I also bring hands-on experience with Progressive Web Apps (PWA) — enabling offline functionality, push notifications, and app-like installs that enhance user engagement.

Beyond coding, I value collaboration. I thrive in cross-functional teams, working closely with designers, backend engineers, and product managers to deliver seamless, high-quality user experiences. I also practice writing clean, maintainable code, conducting code reviews, and leveraging testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure reliability.

In short, I’m a problem-solver, a collaborator, and a developer passionate about building modern, efficient, and impactful web applications that scale
